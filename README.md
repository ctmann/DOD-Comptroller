# DOD-Comptroller

Each February, the [DOD Comptroller]("https://comptroller.defense.gov/Budget-Materials/Budget2019/") publishes department-wide budget documents that summarize the Administration's request for military appropriations. The Department provides spreadsheets and other items (such as press releases and ad hoc reports) that describe anticipated spending at varying levels of detail for the coming fiscal year.

Following the February release, it is not uncommon for the Administration to request additional amounts, prompted by unfolding emergencies or other natural disasters, or in response to unforseen national security concerns. In these cases, rather than altering existing data, the DOD Comptroller typically republishes reports in new, clearly defined sections that describe the purpose for the changes. See, for example, the FY2017 "March 2017 Request for Additional Appropriations - Budget Line Item Summary Documents."

The release of new data on a rolling basis makes the Comptroller's website difficult to predict (from a webscraping point-of-view). Each FY is idiosyncratically arrayed with novel or updated data, and new sections are described colloquially rather than with a consistent naming convention (for example, "Amendment", "Supplemental", "Disaster", etc.).
